# Drone Simulation - Laboratory 2 - Simulacoes de Drones e Aplicacoes

Authors: Leonardo Silveira, Mateus Rodrigues de Barros

This repository holds the code of a drone simulation, done using Processing. 

The simulation encompasses the following features:
- Paparazzi movements: eight, stay-at, way-point, and oval;
- Stochastic finite state machine, managing the movements of the drone;
- Wind effects, modelled using Perlin noise.
