This repository holds the code of a drone simulation, done using Processing.
The simulation encompasses the following features:
•	Paparazzi movements: eight, stay-at, way-point, and oval;
•	Stochastic finite state machine, managing the movements of the drone;
•	Wind effects, modelled using Perlin noise.
